## Key Features

- **Higher FPS, fewer lags**  
  Sodium and Lithium optimize rendering and game logic, easing the load on CPU and GPU so the game runs smoother even on lower-end PCs.

- **Immersive atmosphere**  
  Ambient music, surface-dependent footsteps, and realistic world sounds create a true sense of presence. Leaves rustle in the wind, and raindrops softly patter on blocks.

- **User-friendly interface**  
  Achievement information flips through pages like a book, you can reload arrows with a single click, and the advancement log gains paginated navigation.

- **Varied exploration**  
  Dungeons, fortresses, and mineshafts feature new hidden chambers and treasure rooms—no more dull corridors, but real challenges with secret rewards.

- **Little joys & Easter eggs**  
  - Dynamic torch lighting in hand.  
  - Bubble sounds when moving underwater.  
  - Fruit on trees subtly shifts hue with the seasons.
